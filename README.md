# Weather-App

A weather app that uses FreeCodeCamp's open weather API. When the user allows the app to use his/her location, the app will present weather-related information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

Also, the background image will change depending on whether it's day or night at the user's location, as well as current weather conditions. Currently, the supported weather conditions are:

- Clear
- Clouds
- Rain
- Thunderstorm
- Snow
- Fog
- Mist
